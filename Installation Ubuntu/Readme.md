For ou project , we are supposed to use the **ROS NOESTIC** distrubution in order to command our robot.
To do so , we need firstly to install **Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop** for Raspberry Pi 4.
In our case , we choosed the **Ubuntu 20.04 Mate** version.


## Pre-installation

We go to the [officiel website](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/)  and download the system image for Raspberry 4 , and we choose the 20.04 version.

Next , we burn the iso file on our Sd card ( using for example [RP imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/))


## Update and Upgrade

After successufuly installing Ubuntu Mate , we ended up with this desktop :

We check if our system is up to date , and upgraded.
In terminal
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```


## Installation of raspi-config menu
Raspi-config is a command that allows you to configurate your RP ( Enabling camera , ssh , vnc ....)
In the terminal :
```sh
wget http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/raspi-config/raspi-config_20201108_all.deb
sudo apt install lua5.1  libatopology2 libfftw3-single3 libsamplerate0 alsa-utils
sudo dpkg -i raspi-config_20201108_all.deb
```
Open raspi-config
```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

Sometimes , you can have an old version of raspi-config , therefore you might not see some fearutres such as Interfacing options ( Camera , Ssh ....).
To solve this problem , we must update the firmware of our raspberry .
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update)



## Enabling Ssh
Ssh is a way to control your RPi remotley . To enable Ssh on ubuntu :
```sh
sudo apt install openssh-client
```
